# Introduction to Computer Networks

## Introduction 
A computer network or data network, is a digital telecommunication network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using datalink. The connection b/w nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media.

**Objectives**

* Transfer data from one machine to another.
* Facilitate sharing of data
* Facilitate access of remote information

**Application**

* World Wide Web
* Online Social Networks
* Email

## Network Hardware 
There are two types of transmission technology

1. Broadcast links
2. Point to Point Links

Broadcast networks have single communication channel that is shared by all machines on network packets (short messages** sent by any machine are recieved by all others. Address fields with the packet specifies intended recipient. Upon recieving machine checks address field. 

If the packet is intended for recieving, it processes the packet else ignores it.

**Broadcasting** : Possibility of addressing packet to all destinations by using special code in address field. It is recieved and processed by every machine on the network.

**Multicasting** : Source node sends message to some subset of other nodes, but not all of them.

**Unicasting** : Point to Point transmission with one sender and one reciever.

## Types of Networks
Classification of networks based on scale and distance

| Distance  | Located in Same | Example  |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 m       | Square Meter    | PAN      |
| 10 m      | Room            | LAN      |
| 100 m     | Building        | LAN      |
| 1 Km      | Campus          | LAN      |
| 10 Km     | City            | MAN      |
| 100 Km    | Country         | WAN      |
| 1000 Km   | Contitent       | WAN      |
| 10,000 Km | Planet          | Internet |

### Personal Area Network (PAN)
PAN are mainly set up for single person use.

### LAN 
### MAN
### WAN
