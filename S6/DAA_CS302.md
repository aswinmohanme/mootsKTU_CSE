## Algorithm
An Algorithm is a finite set of instructions which if followed accomplishes a particular task.

### Criteria 
* **Input **: The algorithm must have some quantities externally supplied
* **Output **: The algorithm must produce atleast one output
* **Definitness**: Each instruction must be clear and unambigous
* **Finiteness**: Algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps
* **Effectiveness**: Every instruction must be sufficiently basic that we can do with pen and paper if neccessary.
