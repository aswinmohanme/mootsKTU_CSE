## Algorithm
An Algorithm is a finite set of instructions which if followed accomplishes a particular task.

### Criteria 
* **Input**: The algorithm must have some quantities externally supplied
* **Output**: The algorithm must produce atleast one output
* **Definitness**: Each instruction must be clear and unambigous
* **Finiteness**: Algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps
* **Effectiveness**: Every instruction must be sufficiently basic that we can do with pen and paper if neccessary.

## Complexity Analysis
Algorithms can be tested in a lot of ways. They can be tested for logical correctness by tracing it's execution for a sample input space.

### Space Complexity
Space Complexity measures the space requirements of the current algorithm. Analysis of SC gives the amount of memory it needs to complete it's execution.

### Time Complexity
