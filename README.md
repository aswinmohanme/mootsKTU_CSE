# Massive Online Open Textboks - KTU
MOOTS are open-source textbooks written by students, verified by the faculty and tailored for the syllabus taught at the university.

## Principles
* Each textbook should be self sufficient for a motivated self learner
* Each textbook should be written in the simplest language possible, with textbook definitions quoted
* Each textbook should match the syllabus taught at the university.
